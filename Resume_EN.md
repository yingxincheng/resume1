Education background
--------------------

- **Software Institute, Nanjing University**
	* M.S. in Software Engineering.	<time>09/2012 - 07/2015</time>  
		GPA: 89.4/100.0  
		Area: Computer Forensics, Software Engineering.
	* B.S. in Software Engineering.	<time>09/2008 - 07/2012</time>  
		GPA: 84.0/100.0  
		Honor: Third-class people's scholarship of 2009, Second-class people's scholarship of 2010.

Major Experience
----------------

- **Tianjin Court Case Management System(Java EE)**	<time>05/2014 - 09/2014</time>
	* Participate in a team to develop an online case management system for 3 levels of courts in Tianjin.
	* Responsible for product-line subsystem refactoring and case data import implementation. The product-line subsystem manages 61 different types of cases with 130 judicial work components. And the import module can import all kinds of cases locally or from another court with reliability.  

- **Memory behavior monitor for live forensics(C)**	<time>12/2013 - 07/2014</time>
	* Invented a para-synchronized approach to monitor memory behavior of processes for live forensics based on prior-implemented hypervisor.  
	* This approach can acquire a complete evidence chain from a hook behavior to a process and to an EXE image with the process's running snapshots from 64-bit multi-core systems.  
	* The introduced overhead is about 27% to the system, 88% of which comes from memory virtualization(EPT).

- **Hardware virtualization based late-launch hypervisor(C)**	 <time>05/2013 - 11/2013</time>
	* Find a research area independently and absorb knowledge about hardware virtualization from NewBluePill source code and intel developer's manual.  
	* Repair and refine initiation process of NewBluePill and add more features such as memory virtualization, hypervisor control, etc. for future research.  
	* The hypervisor can do P2V migration without rebooting target OS.

- **Supreme Court Case Management System - Workflow Subsystem(Java)**	<time>03/2013 - 06/2013</time>
	* Designed and implemented a workflow-like subsystem.  
	* After 2 major refactoring, the system controls main and sub-processes of every cases with rules.  
	* The system is designed to have version control of process definitions, so the case states are maintained after updating the definition. In order to minimize database accesses, 5 inner states of process instance and 3 states of process definition are designed to switch automatically according to service invocation.

- **Others**
	* Personalized BBS Information push system(Python)  
	* LCD digit image recognition(Java)  
	* Game Sudoku(C++)

Publications
------------

- **Patents**
	* Patentee of "A modular forensic system based on hardware virtualization". Application No. 201410202898.0  
	* Patentee of "Collect and intercept memory behavior on a running system". Application No. 201410203373.9 	
- **Essays**
	* Investigating the Hooking Behavior: A page-level memory monitoring method for Live Forensics. ISC 2014 in Hong Kong University. (Waiting for notification)
